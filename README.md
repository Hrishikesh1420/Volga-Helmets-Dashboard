In my final year of college I was doing an internship on Microsoft Power BI assosiate at the end of the course we were given an excel datasheet containing a lot of sales data, each one of us had to select any company use that data and make a dashboard out of it, I choose the company volga helmets as my dashboard company and modelled the data into my needs added a lot of different columns, formulas etc to fit my needs and then created this Dashboard.
